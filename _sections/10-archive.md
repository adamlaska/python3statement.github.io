# History

This page is now an archive of part of the transition from Python 2 to 3.

By around 2015, when Python 2 support was originally planned to end, many
important Python libraries and tools supported Python 3. But Python 2 still had
a lot of users, and projects needed to support both major versions. The end of
Python 2 support was postponed to 2020, and some people argued that development
of Python 2 should resume. It seemed like a real possibility that the end date
would be postponed again, and we'd need to support two versions of the language
indefinitely.

The Python 3 statement was drawn up around 2016. Projects pledged to require
Python 3 by 2020, giving other projects confidence that they could plan a similar
transition, and allowing downstream users to figure out their options without a
nasty surprise. We didn't force people to move to Python 3, but if they wanted
to stick with Python 2, they would stop getting new versions of our projects.
The focus was originally on the scientific Python ecosystem, with Jupyter and
matplotlib among the first projects involved, but in late 2017 it was expanded
to any Python projects.
A rapidly growing number of projects signed up as we approached 2020.

The long-term transition we hoped for has succeeded: in 2024 it is entirely
normal for projects to support only Python 3, simplifying maintainers' lives
and letting us take full advantage of newer language features.

Thank-you to all of the people, in projects big and small, who contributed
their support to the statement!
